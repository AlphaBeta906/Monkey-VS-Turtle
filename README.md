# Monkey VS Turtle

## What is it and how do I play it?
This game is simple. It's a 2-player text-based fighting game which is currently in development. It has 2 characters: A monkey and a turtle. Your main goal is to take down your enemy's HP to 0, as you could've guessed.

Your ATK is how much you can deal to the enemy and your DEF is how many defense you take. The more ATK you have, the more damage the enemy will take. The more DEF, the less damage you take when the enemy is attacking you.

Each character has 4 items which they can use to temporarily or permanently increase their ATK/DEF.
If you want to have an advantage with the ATK, start off as a monkey. If you want more DEF, start off as a turtle.

## How do I download it?
Currently, it is not recommended to download the game for it isn't finished. A .exe file will be made after the game is 100% completed.

If you want to test it out, you can learn more in the testing.txt file.

## Other info
To see the development log, check out the devlog.txt file.

This is also my first game as a python programmer, so prepare for some awfully written code. I am aiming to refine it when I complete everything.
