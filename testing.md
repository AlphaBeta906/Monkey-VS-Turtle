# How to download the testing version
To download the unfinished, current version (which is, I warn you, a bit unstable with the code) you must have downloaded Python 3.7 or higher. If you don't have it, scroll down to the "Download Python 3.7 section".

## Download Python 3.7
Step 1. Go to www.python.org/downloads/. It will automatically determine your OS you are using.
Step 2. Download any Python version which is 3.7 or later. Do not confused 2.7 with 3.7!

## Setting up a folder and getting the current files
Step 1. Create a folder anywhere on your computer. This folder is necessary so the game can locate its files.
Step 2. ONLY download MonkeyVSTurtle.py and Character.py, the other files are not necessary for the game to work.
Step 3. Put these files in the folder you made in step 1.

## Running the code/Playing the game
Step 1. Open IDLE, a coding environment which can run Python.
Step 2. In IDLE, open MonkeyVSTurtle.py.
Step 3. Run it by going to "Run" > "Run Module" OR hit F5(sometimes, you will need to hold down the Fn key).

## Why do I need to download Python?
This game has not been "frozen" yet. To freeze something it means to create an executable file of it, and there isn't one of the game because it's still a work-in-progress. You can uninstall Python after testing the game out.
